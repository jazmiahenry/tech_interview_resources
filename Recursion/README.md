# What is Recursion?

Recursion is a series of subtasks within a function that calls on itself. It is a simpler and cleaner way to solve technical problems, though it is often a more time intensive solution and is often a Brute Force solution to a task. 

Recursion can be used on the following Data Structures:
- Trees
- Linked Lists
- Graphs
- Heaps


Recursion is used in the following Algorithms:
- Graph Traversial 
- Quicksort
- Mergesort
- Binary Search

Recursion requires 3 things:

1. You establish a "base case" or a place where you want for the function to begin. In the case of a tree structure, this would require you to call on the tree's node before traversing the rest of the tree.
 
2. You call on the function within itself, triggering a recursive call.

3. You specify the function's exit so that the function does not call on itself infinitely.
