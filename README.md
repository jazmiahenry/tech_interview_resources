# Technical Interview Resources

Hello, everybody!
Welcome to my repo on technical interview resources. This repo is just a 101 introduction to technical interview prep and is meant to explain complex ideas in a simple way for you to get started.

This repo assumes basic understanding of how to code and Data Structures and Algorithms. 

If you do not have basic understanding in either, have no fear- there are free resources online for you to use. 

* To better understand coding in Python, follow this free course here:

* For more information on Data Structures and Algorithms, watch this free course here:

** Report any bugs, concerns, or questions about the code in the practice problems folder in the bug_tracker.md file. Thanks.
