## Big O Notation Defined

Big O notation describes the limit or upper bound of a function as it computes a desired output. It can help measure the complexity of the time and space of an algorithm.

Time complexity is concerned with the time it takes to complete a task.
Space complexity is concerned with the memory it takes to complete a task.

Common Complexities are as followed:
